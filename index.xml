      <description>MongoDB is scalable and schema-less NoSQL key-value storage, which makes it handy for applications to use as a persistent layer. The two features in this post views and change streams from MongoDB can turn your application into a full-fetched back-end engine for data-intensive applications.
Change Streams Since MongoDB 3.6 you can use change streams to create event-driven applications for data processing. Whenever an update occurs in a specific collection, MongoDB triggers a change event with the modified data.</description>

      <description>Me As a trained statistician with a passion for coding, I have honed my abilities to leverage data and drive insights. Python is my current go-to when it comes to programming languages, however, I am drawn to the power and potential of Rust. In my current role as a data scientist and machine learning engineer, I am constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible with data-driven solutions.
